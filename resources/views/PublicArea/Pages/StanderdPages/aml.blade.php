        <h3>
            1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Company Policy</h3>

        <p>
            It is the policy of Solar Oil Enterprises Limited (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) to prohibit and actively
            prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist
            or criminal activities by complying with all applicable requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
            and its implementing regulations.</p>
        <p>
            <br></p>
        <p>
            Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true
            origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate
            origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first
            enters the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage, where the cash generated from criminal
            activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler&apos;s checks, or
            deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are
            transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money
            from its criminal origin. At the &quot;integration&quot; stage, the funds are reintroduced into the
            economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate
            businesses.</p>
        <p>
            <br></p>
        <p>
            Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal
            either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could be for criminal purposes. Legitimate
            sources of funds are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal
            organizations. In addition to charitable donations, legitimate sources include foreign government
            sponsors, business ownership and personal employment. Although the motivation differs between
            traditional money launderers and terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist
            operations can be the same as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder funds. Funding
            for terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of money and the associated transactions may
            not be complex.</p>
        <p>
            <br></p>
        <p>
            Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable
            BSA regulations and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies,
            procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both changes in regulations and changes in
            our business.</p>

            2.&nbsp;&nbsp;AML Compliance Person Designation and Duties</h3>
        <p>
            The Company has designated its Chief Compliance Officer as its Anti-Money Laundering Program Compliance
            Person (AML Compliance Person), with full responsibility for the Company&rsquo;s AML program. The AML
            Compliance Person has a working knowledge of the BSA and its implementing regulations and is qualified
            by experience, knowledge and training. The duties of the AML Compliance Person will include monitoring
            the Company&rsquo;s compliance with AML obligations, overseeing communication and training for
            employees<em>.&nbsp;</em>The AML Compliance Person will also ensure that the Company keeps and maintains
            all of the required AML records and will ensure that Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR-SFs) are filed
            with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when appropriate. The AML Compliance Person is
            vested with full responsibility and authority to enforce the Company&rsquo;s AML program.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.FinCEN Requests Under USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(a)</h3>
        <p>
            <br></p>
        <p>
            We will respond to a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) request concerning accounts and
            transactions (a 314(a) Request) by immediately searching our records to determine whether we maintain or
            have maintained any account for, or have engaged in any transaction with, each individual, entity or
            organization named in the 314(a) Request as outlined in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) located on
            FinCEN&rsquo;s secure Web site. We understand that we have 14 days (unless otherwise specified by
            FinCEN) from the transmission date of the request to respond to a 314(a) Request. Unless otherwise
            specified by FinCEN, we are required to search those documents outlined in FinCEN&rsquo;s FAQ. If we
            find a match, the AML Compliance Person will report it to FinCEN via FinCEN&rsquo;s Web-based 314(a)
            Secure Information Sharing System within 14 days or within the time requested by FinCEN in the request.
            If the search parameters differ from those mentioned above (for example, if FinCEN limits the search to
            a geographic location), the AML Compliance Person will structure our search accordingly.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the AML Compliance Person searches our records and does not find a matching account or transaction,
            then the AML Compliance Person will not reply to the 314(a) Request. We will maintain documentation that
            we have performed the required search.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will not disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested or obtained information from us, except to the
            extent necessary to comply with the information request. The AML Compliance Person will review, maintain
            and implement procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of requests from FinCEN similar to
            those procedures established to satisfy the requirements of Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
            regarding the protection of customers&rsquo; nonpublic information.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>We
            will direct any questions we have about the 314(a) Request to the requesting federal law enforcement
            agency as designated in the request.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) Request, we will not be required to treat the information request
            as continuing in nature, and we will not be required to treat the periodic 314(a) Requests as a
            government provided list of suspected terrorists for purposes of the customer identification and
            verification requirements.</p>

            We understand that the receipt of a grand jury subpoena concerning a customer does not in itself require
            that we file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR-SF). When we receive a grand jury subpoena, we will
            conduct a risk assessment of the customer subject to the subpoena as well as review the customer&rsquo;s
            account activity. If we uncover suspicious activity during our risk assessment and review, we will
            elevate that customer&rsquo;s risk assessment and file a SAR-SF in accordance with the SAR-SF filing
            requirements. We understand that none of our officers, employees or agents may directly or indirectly
            disclose to the person who is the subject of the subpoena its existence, its contents or the information
            we used to respond to it. To maintain the confidentiality of any grand jury subpoena we receive, we will
            process and maintain the subpoena by the AML Compliance Person. If we file a SAR-SF after receiving a
            grand jury subpoena, the SAR-SF will not contain any reference to the receipt or existence of the
            subpoena. The SAR-SF will only contain detailed information about the facts and circumstances of the
            detected suspicious activity.</p>

        <p>
            We will share information with other financial institutions regarding individuals, entities,
            organizations and countries for purposes of identifying and, where appropriate, reporting activities
            that we suspect may involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering. Ken Jeon will ensure that
            the Company files with FinCEN an initial notice before any sharing occurs and annual notices thereafter.
            We will use the notice form found at <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN&rsquo;s Web site</a>.
            Before we share information with another financial institution, we will take reasonable steps to verify
            that the other financial institution has submitted the requisite notice to FinCEN, either by obtaining
            information from the financial institution or by consulting a list of such financial institutions that
            FinCEN will make available. We understand that this requirement applies even to financial
            institutions<em>&nbsp;with which we are affiliated</em>, and that we will obtain the requisite notices
            from affiliates and follow all required procedures<em>.</em></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>
            We will employ strict procedures both to ensure that only relevant information is shared and to protect
            the security and confidentiality of this information, for example, by segregating it from the
            Company&rsquo;s other books and records.</p>
        <p>

        <p>
            Before opening an account, and on an ongoing basis, the AML Compliance Person will check to ensure that
            a customer does not appear on the SDN list or is not engaging in transactions that are prohibited by the
            economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by OFAC. Because the SDN list and listings of
            economic sanctions and embargoes are updated frequently, we will consult them on a regular basis and
            subscribe to receive any available updates when they occur. With respect to the SDN list, we may also
            access that list through various software programs to ensure speed and accuracy. <em>See also</em> <a

            that screens names against the SDN list. AML Compliance Person will also review existing accounts
            against the SDN list and listings of current sanctions and embargoes when they are updated and he will
            document the review.</p>
        <p>
            <br></p>
        <p>
            If we determine that a customer is on the SDN list or is engaging in transactions that are prohibited by
            the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by OFAC, we will reject the transaction
            and/or block the customer&apos;s assets and file some blocked assets and/or rejected transaction form
            with OFAC within 10 days. We will also call the OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 immediately.</p>

                Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure that we have a
                reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our customers by using risk-based procedures to

                use
                documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents are available. In light of the
                increased instances of identity fraud, we will supplement the use of documentary evidence by using
                the
                non-documentary means described below whenever necessary. We may also use non-documentary means, if
                we
                are still uncertain about whether we know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the
                information, we will consider whether the identifying information that we receive, such as the
                customer&rsquo;s name, street address, zip code, telephone number (if provided), date of birth and
                Social Security number, allow us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true

                being properly identified. We will also take the following additional measures that may be used to

            <p>
                We will identify foreign bank accounts and any such account that is a correspondent account (any
                account
                that is established for a foreign bank to receive deposits from, or to make payments or other
                disbursements on behalf of, the foreign bank, or to handle other financial transactions related to
                such
                foreign bank) for foreign shell banks. Upon finding or suspecting such accounts, Company employees
                will
                notify the AML Compliance Person, who will terminate any verified correspondent account in the
                United
                States for a foreign shell bank. We will also terminate any correspondent account that we have
                determined is not maintained by a foreign shell bank but is being used to provide services to such a
                shell bank. We will exercise caution<strong>&nbsp;</strong>regarding liquidating positions in such
                accounts and take reasonable steps to ensure that no new positions are established in these accounts
                during the termination period. We will terminate any correspondent account for which we have not
                obtained the information described in Appendix A of the regulations regarding shell banks within the
                time periods specified in those regulations.</p>

                We will require our foreign bank account holders to identify the owners of the foreign bank if it is
                not
                publicly traded, the name and street address of a person who resides in the United States and is
                authorized and has agreed to act as agent for acceptance of legal process, and an assurance that the
                foreign bank is not a shell bank nor is it facilitating activity of a shell bank. In lieu of this
                information the foreign bank may submit the Certification Regarding Correspondent Accounts For
                Foreign
                Banks provided in the BSA regulations. We will re-certify when we believe that the information is no

                foreign financial institution correspondent sufficient to ensure whether the nature and volume of
                account activity is generally consistent with the information regarding the purpose and expected
                account
                activity and to ensure that the Company can adequately identify suspicious transactions. Ordinarily,
                we
                will not conduct this periodic review by scrutinizing every transaction taking place within the
                account.
                One procedure we may use instead is to use any account profiles for our correspondent accounts (to
                the
                extent we maintain these) that we ordinarily use to anticipate how the account might be used and the
                expected volume of activity to help establish baselines for detecting unusual activity.</p>

            <p>
                We will review our accounts to determine whether we offer any private banking accounts and we will
                conduct due diligence on such accounts. This due diligence will include, at least, (1) ascertaining
                the
                identity of all nominal holders and holders of any beneficial ownership interest in the account
                (including information on those holders&apos; lines of business and sources of wealth); (2)
                ascertaining
                the source of funds deposited into the account; (3) ascertaining whether any such holder may be a
                senior
                foreign political figure; and (4) detecting and reporting, in accordance with applicable laws and
                regulations, any known or suspected money laundering, or use of the proceeds of foreign corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br></p>
            <p>
                We will review public information, including information available in Internet databases, to
                determine
                whether any private banking account holders are senior foreign political figures. If we discover
                information indicating that a particular private banking account holder may be a senior foreign
                political figure, and upon taking additional reasonable steps to confirm this information, we
                determine
                that the individual is, in fact, a senior foreign political figure, we will conduct additional
                enhanced
                due diligence to detect and report transactions that may involve money laundering or the proceeds of
                foreign corruption.</p>
            <p>
                <br></p>
            <p>
                In so doing, we will consider the risks that the funds in the account may be the proceeds of foreign
                corruption by determining the purpose and use of the private banking account, location of the
                account
                holder(s), source of funds in the account, type of transactions conducted through the account and
                jurisdictions involved in such transactions. The degree of scrutiny we will apply will depend on
                various
                risk factors, including, but not limited to, whether the jurisdiction the senior foreign political
                figure is from is one in which current or former political figures have been implicated in
                corruption
                and the length of time that a former political figure was in office. Our enhanced due diligence
                might
                include, depending on the risk factors, probing the account holder&apos;s employment history,
                scrutinizing the account holder&apos;s source(s) of funds, and monitoring transactions to the extent
                necessary to detect and report proceeds of foreign corruption, and reviewing monies coming from

                In situations involving violations that require immediate attention, such as terrorist financing or
                ongoing money laundering schemes, we will immediately call an appropriate law enforcement authority.
                If
                a customer or company appears on OFAC&rsquo;s SDN list, we will call the OFAC Hotline at (800)
                540-6322.
                Other contact numbers we will use are: FinCEN&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Hotline ((866)
                556-3974)
                (especially to report transactions relating to terrorist activity), local U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s

                (<em>insert contact number)</em> (to voluntarily report such violations to the SEC in addition to
                contacting the appropriate law enforcement authority). If we notify the appropriate law enforcement

                (7277)
                to alert the SEC about the filing. We understand that calling the SEC SAR Alert Message Line does
                not
                alleviate our obligations to file a SAR-SF or notify an appropriate law enforcement authority.</p>

            <p>
                We will also file a SAR-SF and notify the appropriate law enforcement authority in situations
                involving
                violations that require immediate attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering
                schemes. In addition, although we are not required to, we may contact that SEC in cases where a
                SAR-SF
                we have filed may require immediate attention by the SEC. <em>See</em> Section 11 for contact
                numbers.
                We also understand that, even if we notify a regulator of a violation, unless it is specifically
                covered
                by one of the exceptions in the SAR rule, we must file a SAR-SF reporting the violation.</p>
            <p>
                <br></p>
            <p>
                We may file a voluntary SAR-SF for any suspicious transaction that we believe is relevant to the
                possible violation of any law or regulation but that is not required to be reported by us under the
                SAR
                rule. It is our policy that all SAR-SFs will be reported regularly to the Board of Directors and
                appropriate senior management, with a clear reminder of the need to maintain the confidentiality of
                the
                SAR-SF.</p>

                <br></p>
            <p>
                We will report suspicious transactions by completing a SAR-SF, and we will collect and maintain
                supporting documentation as required by the BSA regulations. We will file a SAR-SF no later than 30
                calendar days after the date of the initial detection of the facts that constitute a basis for
                filing a
                SAR-SF. If no suspect is identified on the date of initial detection, we may delay filing the SAR-SF
                for
                an additional 30 calendar days pending identification of a suspect, but in no case will the
                reporting be
                delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection. The phrase &ldquo;initial
                detection&rdquo; does not mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day (or
                60-day) period begins when an appropriate review is conducted and a determination is made that the
                transaction under review is &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; within the meaning of the SAR requirements. A
                review must be initiated promptly upon identification of unusual activity that warrants
                investigation.

                We will retain copies of any SAR-SF filed and the original or business record equivalent of any
                supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing the SAR-SF. We will identify and
                maintain supporting documentation and make such information available to FinCEN, any other
                appropriate
                law enforcement agencies, federal or state securities regulators or SROs upon request.</p>

                <br></p>
            <p>
                We will not notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported,
                except
                as permitted by the BSA regulations. We understand that anyone who is subpoenaed or required to
                disclose
                a SAR-SF or the information contained in the SAR-SF will, except where disclosure is requested by
                FinCEN, the SEC, or another appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agency, or an SRO registered
                with
                the SEC, decline to produce the SAR-SF or to provide any information that would disclose that a
                SAR-SF

                Company must file a currency transaction report (CTR) for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of
                currency, or other payment or transfer by, through or to the Company that involves a transaction in
                currency of more than $10,000 or for multiple transactions in currency of more than $10,000 when a

                one
                business day, unless the transaction is subject to certain exemptions. &ldquo;Currency&rdquo; is

                Currency
                includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes, Federal Reserve notes, and official foreign bank
                notes
                that are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in a foreign country.</p>

                Our Company prohibits transactions involving currency in excess of $10,000 If we discover such
                transactions have occurred, we will file with FinCEN CTRs for currency transactions that exceed
                $10,000.
                Also, we will treat multiple transactions involving currency as a single transaction for purposes of
                determining whether to file a CTR if they total more than $10,000 and are made by or on behalf of

                size, its customer base, and its resources and be updated as necessary to reflect any new

                <br></p>
            <p>
                Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags and signs of money laundering
                that arise during the course of the employees&rsquo; duties; (2) what to do once the risk is
                identified
                (including how, when and to whom to escalate unusual customer activity or other red flags for
                analysis
                and, where appropriate, the filing of SAR-SFs); (3) what employees&apos; roles are in the
                Company&apos;s
                compliance efforts and how to perform them; (4) the Company&apos;s record retention policy; and (5)
                the
                disciplinary consequences (including civil and criminal penalties) for non-compliance with the BSA.
