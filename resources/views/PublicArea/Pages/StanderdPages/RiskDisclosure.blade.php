                    <p>Solar Oil Enterprises Limited (the “Company”) wants you to be aware of certain risks associated
                        with use of this website and your investment in our cryptocurrency, including:
                    </p>
                    <br>



                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Demand for Cryptocurrency</u>.
                        Cryptocurrency is a
                        digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a
                        store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes
                        exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally
                        backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by
                        market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The
                        value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to
                        exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and
                        total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency
                        disappear.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Government Approval</u>. Cryptocurrencies
                        are not
                        covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the
                        state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and
                        value of cryptocurrency. Purchasing cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including
                        volatile market price swings or flash crashes, fraud, market manipulation, and cybersecurity
                        risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same
                        controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange
                        investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today
                        will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the
                        legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing.
                    </p>
                    <br>


                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Blockchain Risk</u>. The features,
                        functions,
                        characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be
                        complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable
                        to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power
                        sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency's blockchain or other
                        underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded
                        on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been
                        initiated.
                    </p>
                    <br>


                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Superior Knowledge</u>. Cryptocurrency
                        trading
                        requires knowledge of cryptocurrency markets. In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency
                        trading you must compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate knowledge and
                        experience before engaging in substantial cryptocurrency trading. Any individual cryptocurrency
                        may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to changes made to its underlying
                        technology, changes made using its underlying technology, or changes resulting from an attack.
                        These changes may include, without limitation, a "fork," a "rollback," an "airdrop," or a
                        "bootstrap." Such changes may dilute the value of an existing cryptocurrency position and/or
                        distribute the value of an existing cryptocurrency position to another cryptocurrency. Any
                        cryptocurrency may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their
                        value, due to forks, rollbacks, attacks, or failures to operate as intended.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Technological Risk</u>. The nature of
                        cryptocurrency means that any technological difficulties experienced by the Company may prevent
                        the access of your cryptocurrency. Any surety bonds or insurance maintained by the Company for
                        the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.
                        Cryptocurrency trading can be extremely risky. Cryptocurrency trading may not generally be
                        appropriate, particularly with funds drawn from retirement savings, student loans, mortgages,
                        emergency funds, or funds set aside for other purposes. Cryptocurrency trading can lead to large
                        and immediate financial losses. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of
                        cryptocurrency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Liquidity Risk</u>. Transactions in
                        cryptocurrency
                        may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may
                        not be recoverable. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to
                        liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price. This can occur, for example, when the market
                        for a particular cryptocurrency suddenly drops, or if trading is halted due to recent news
                        events, unusual trading activity, or changes in the underlying cryptocurrency system. The
                        greater the volatility of a particular cryptocurrency, the greater the likelihood that problems
                        may be encountered in executing a transaction. In addition to normal market risks, you may
                        experience losses due to one or more of the following: system failures, hardware failures,
                        software failures, network connectivity disruptions, and data corruption.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Regulatory Risk</u>. Regulation of tokens
                        token
                        sales, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges currently is
                        undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal,
                        state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and
                        executive bodies may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which
                        may severely impact the development, growth, adoption and utility of the cryptocurrency. Failure
                        by the Fund or certain issuers of cryptocurrency to comply with any laws, rules and regulations,
                        some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change,
                        could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. Until
                        recently, little or no regulatory attention has been directed toward cryptocurrency by state
                        governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrencies have grown in
                        popularity and in market size, various governments have begun to examine the operations of the
                        cryptocurrency issuers, users and cryptocurrency exchanges.
                    </p>
                    <br>


                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Government Prohibition</u>. Although
                        currently
                        cryptocurrencies are not regulated or is lightly regulated in most countries, one or more
                        countries such as China, Iceland, Viet Nam and Russia may take regulatory actions in the future
                        that severely restricts the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrency or to
                        exchange cryptocurrency for fiat currency. Such an action may also result in the restriction of
                        ownership, holding or trading in cryptocurrency.
                    </p>
                    <br>



                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Price Volatility</u>. The prices of
                        cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies could
                        materially and adversely affect our business, and the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio may
                        also be subject to significant price volatility. The prices of cryptocurrency have historically
                        been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. Several factors may influence the
                        market price of cryptocurrencies, including, but not limited to:

                                cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain
                                asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the

                            security breach that affects holders of a particular cryptocurrency may negatively impact
                            holders of other cryptocurrencies, or user confidence in any one cryptocurrency may affect
                            the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of all cryptocurrencies and other
                            blockchain assets to fluctuate.</p>
