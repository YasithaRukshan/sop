                Personal Data Protection Policy</h3>

            <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 The General
                Data Protection Regulation</h3>
            <p>The General
                Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) is one of the most significant pieces of legislation affecting
                the way that the Company carries out its information processing activities. Significant fines are
                applicable if a breach is deemed to have occurred under the GDPR, which is designed to protect the
                personal data of citizens of the European Union. It is the Company&rsquo;s policy to ensure that our
                compliance with the GDPR and other relevant legislation is clear and demonstrable at all times.</p>


            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Definitions</h3>
            <p>There are a
                total of 26 definitions listed within the GDPR and it is not appropriate to reproduce them all here.
                However, the most fundamental definitions with respect to this policy are as follows:</p>
            <p>Personal
                data is defined as:</p>
            <p>any
                information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;); an
                identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
                reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier
                or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural
                or social identity of that natural person;</p>
            <p>
                &lsquo;Processing&rsquo; means:</p>
            <p>any
                operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether
                or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation
                or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
                making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</p>
            <p>
                &lsquo;Controller&rsquo; means:</p>
            <p>the natural
                or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
                the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such
                processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
                nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 Principles Relating to Processing of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>There are
                several fundamental principles upon which the GDPR is based. These are as follows:</p>
            <p>1.Personal
                data shall be:</p>
            <p>(a)processed
                lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (&lsquo;lawfulness,
                fairness and transparency&rsquo;);</p>
            <p>(b)collected
                for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
                incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
                scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article
                89(1), not be incompatible with the initial purposes (&lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;);</p>
            <p>(c)adequate,
                relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
                (&lsquo;data minimization&rsquo;);</p>
            <p>(d)accurate
                and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data
                that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified
                without delay (&lsquo;accuracy&rsquo;);</p>
            <p>(e)kept in a
                form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
                which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
                personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
                historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to
                implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation in
                order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (&lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;);</p>
            <p>(f)processed
                in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
                unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
                appropriate technical or organizational measures (&lsquo;integrity and confidentiality&rsquo;).</p>
            <p>2.The
                controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1
                (&lsquo;accountability&rsquo;). The Company will ensure that it complies with all of these principles
                both in the processing it currently carries out and as part of the introduction of new methods of
                processing such as new IT systems.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4 Rights of
                the Individual</h3>
            <p>The data
                subject also has rights under the GDPR. These consist of:</p>
            <p>1.The right
                to be informed</p>
            <p>2.The right
                of access</p>
            <p>3.The right
                to rectification</p>
            <p>4.The right
                to erasure</p>
            <p>5.The right
                to restrict processing</p>
            <p>6.The right
                to data portability</p>
            <p>7.The right
                to object</p>
            <p>8.Rights in
                relation to automated decision making and profiling.</p>
            <p>Each of
                these rights are supported by appropriate procedures within the Company that allow the required action
                to be taken within the timescales stated in the GDPR.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 Lawfulness
                of Processing</h3>
            <p>There are
                six alternative ways in which the lawfulness of a specific case of processing of personal data may be
                established under the GDPR. It is the Company&rsquo;s policy to identify the appropriate basis for
                processing and to document it, in accordance with the Regulation. The options are described in brief in
                the following sections.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1 Consent</h3>
            <p>Unless it is
                necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, the Company will always obtain explicit consent from a
                data subject to collect and process their data. In case of children below the age of 16 (a lower age may
                be allowable in specific EU member states) parental consent will be obtained. Transparent information
                about our usage of their personal data will be provided to data subjects at the time that consent is
                obtained and their rights with regard to their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent.
                This information will be provided in an accessible form, written in clear language and free of charge.
                If the personal data are not obtained directly from the data subject then this information will be
                provided to the data subject within a reasonable period after the data are obtained and definitely
                within one month.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.2 Performance of a Contrac</h3>
            <p>Where the
                personal data collected and processed are required to fulfil a contract with the data subject, explicit
                consent is not required. This will often be the case where the contract cannot be completed without the
                personal data in question e.g. a delivery cannot be made without an address to deliver to.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.3 Legal
                Obligation</h3>
            <p>If the
                personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit
                consent is not required. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for
                example, and for many areas addressed by the public sector.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.4 Vital
                Interests of the Data Subject</h3>
            <p>In a case
                where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
                natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing. The Company will retain
                reasonable, documented evidence that this is the case, whenever this reason is used as the lawful basis
                of the processing of personal data. As an example, this may be used in aspects of social care,
                particularly in the public sector.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.5 Task
                Carried Out in the Public Interest</h3>
            <p>Where the
                Company needs to perform a task that it believes is in the public interest or as part of an official
                duty then the data subject&rsquo;s consent will not be requested. The assessment of the public interest
                or official duty will be documented and made available as evidence where required.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.6 Legitimate Interests</h3>
            <p>If the
                processing of specific personal data is in the legitimate interests of the Company and is judged not to
                affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject in a significant way, then this may be defined as the
                lawful reason for the processing. Again, the reasoning behind this view will be documented.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.6 Privacy
                by Design</h3>
            <p>The Company
                has adopted the principle of privacy by design and will ensure that the definition and planning of all
                new or significantly changed systems that collect or process personal data will be subject to due
                consideration of privacy issues, including the completion of one or more data protection impact
                assessments.</p>
            <p>The data
                protection impact assessment will include:</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of how personal data will be processed and for what purposes</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of whether the proposed processing of personal data is both necessary and proportionate
                to the purpose(s)</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of the risks to individuals in processing the personal data</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
                controls are necessary to address the identified risks and demonstrate compliance with legislation</p>
            <p>Use of
                techniques such as data minimization and pseudonymization will be considered where applicable and
                appropriate.</p>
            <p><br></p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.7 Contracts
                Involving the Processing of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>The Company
                will ensure that all relationships it enters into that involve the processing of personal data are
                subject to a documented contract that includes the specific information and terms required by the GDPR.
                For more information, see the GDPR Controller-Processor Agreement Policy.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.8 International Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>Transfers of
                personal data outside the European Union will be carefully reviewed prior to the transfer taking place
                to ensure that they fall within the limits imposed by the GDPR. This depends partly on the European
                Commission&rsquo;s judgement as to the adequacy of the safeguards for personal data applicable in the
                receiving country and this may change over time. Intra-group international data transfers will be
                subject to legally binding agreements referred to as Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which provide
                enforceable rights for data subjects.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.9 Data
                Protection Officer</h3>
            <p>A defined
                role of Data Protection Officer (DPO) is required under the GDPR if an organization is a public
                authority, if it performs large scale monitoring or if it processes particularly sensitive types of data
                on a large scale. The DPO is required to have an appropriate level of knowledge and can either be an in-
                house resource or outsourced to an appropriate service provider. Based on these criteria, the Company
                does not require a Data Protection Officer to be appointed.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.10 Breach
                Notification</h3>
            <p>It is the
                Company&rsquo;s policy to be fair and proportionate when considering the actions to be taken to inform
                affected parties regarding breaches of personal data. In line with the GDPR, where a breach is known to
                have occurred which is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the
                relevant supervisory authority will be informed within 72 hours. This will be managed in accordance with
                our Information Security Incident Response Procedure which sets out the overall process of handling
                information security incidents. Under the GDPR the relevant DPA has the authority to impose a range of
                fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide turnover or twenty million Euros, whichever is the
                higher, for infringements of the regulations.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.11 Addressing
                Compliance to the GDPR</h3>
            <p>The
                following actions are undertaken to ensure that the Company always complies with the accountability
                principle of the GDPR:</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                legal basis for processing personal data is clear and unambiguous</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Data
                Protection Officer is appointed with specific responsibility for data protection in the organization (if
                required)</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
                staff involved in handling personal data understand their responsibilities for following good data
                protection practice</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in data protection has been provided to all staff</p>

                are available to data subjects wishing to exercise their rights regarding personal data and such
                enquiries are handled effectively</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular reviews of procedures involving personal data are carried out</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy by design is adopted for all new or changed systems and processes</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                following documentation of processing activities is recorded:</p>
            <p>
                 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOrganization name and relevant details</p>
            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;TPurposes of

            <p> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCategories
