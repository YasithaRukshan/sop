                                            Our team members have always been passionate about energy technology and
                                            with combined Oil & Gas experience of 70+ years, this was the obvious step.
                                            The
                                            first prototype pneumatic eco-friendly pumps were installed in 2017 on a
                                            series of oil wells to test the viability of this project. Since then, we
                                            have made great leaps forward and
                                            are now able to address this problem at mass scale.

                                            An Oil Well Portfolio (OWP) is a collection of oil wells that submit their
                                            production to SOP.
                                            Each portfolio is made up of oil wells in different locations, managed by
                                            various local
                                            operators to diversify risks. Each OWP shows its total size and estimated
                                            average net oil
                                            production per day. For example, an OWP with staking capacity of 50m SOAX
                                            tokens may produce an average of 170-200 barrels of oil per day, while
                                            another with capacity of 100m
                                            SOAX tokens may average 350-400 barrels of oil per day. Typically, only one
                                            portfolio is
                                            available to stake on, which is replaced with another as it nears
                                            completion.

                                            From the moment of Staking, the stakeholder starts receiving oil production

                                            the oil wells for the next 10 years. Each barrel of oil produced is
                                            represented as the SOPX
                                            token.

                                            For example, an oil well portfolio has a total of 10m SOAX tokens staked and
                                            produces 30
                                            barrels of oil in a day. Let us say you staked 100,000 SOAX tokens. In this
                                            case your wallet
                                            would receive 0.3 barrels of oil or SOPX tokens. To prevent runaway
                                            transaction costs, SOPX
                                            tokens are credited to a wallet when the total rewards accumulation exceeds
                                            0.5 SOPX.

                                            minus $18 (USD). If the current WTI price of oil is $50, then you would
                                            receive $32 equivalent.
                                            In the above example, where you receive .3 SOPX, that would equate to
                                            roughly $9.6

                                            They are! Oil well rehab is a very routine aspect of oil production. Usually
                                            this involves
                                            stimulating down hole pressure via injection sites or making small
                                            optimizations on oil
                                            production itself. However, on exceptionally low volume wells that produce
                                            under 10 barrels
                                            of oil per day, these improvements can be cost prohibitive and are largely
                                            ignored by major
                                            oil corporations. Therefore, SOP contracts with local operators and well
                                            owners where the
                                            properties meet the right parameters to deploy the new pumping technology.
